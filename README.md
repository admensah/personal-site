## Anthony Mensah's Personal Site

Notes: 

Due to a dependency mistmatch the local must have different versions of

package-lock.json
package.json

These versions can be found in the repos first push by admensah: all subsequent 
ones have a newer version that will cause the build to fail on local if placed there.
